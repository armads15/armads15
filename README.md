Hi, I’m Francisco Palenzuela. I am currently a software developer for PNC Bank.
I’m interested in network security and administration and penetration testing.
I am current;y learning Python, Java, and Swift.
I have a background in C/C++, and IBM proprietary software like Business Process Manager and Decision Manager.

If I do upload anything here it might be random Python or Arduino code.
