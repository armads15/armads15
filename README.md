Hi, I’m Francisco Palenzuela. I am currently a software developer for PNC Bank.
I’m interested in network security and administration and penetration testing.
I am currently learning Python and Swift and currently relearning Java and Arduino programming so if I do upload much code here it will probably be those.
I have a background with Java, C/C++, and a few IBM proprietary languages like Business Process Manager and Business Rules Engine.
I have a few certifications including CISSP, CEH, CCNA, and SEC+. Studying for CCNP and PENTEST+ to take soon.
